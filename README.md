## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Kunal Ghosh sir** for his invaluable guidance and mentorship throughout the development of the **Picorv32A chip**. His insights and support were instrumental in the successful completion of this project.

I also extend my appreciation to the **NASSCOM VSD SoC Design Program** for providing a structured learning environment and resources that made this project possible.

A special thanks to the **OpenLane** tool developers and the open-source community for their contributions, which played a crucial role in the design and implementation process.

Finally, I acknowledge everyone who supported and contributed directly or indirectly to this project.
